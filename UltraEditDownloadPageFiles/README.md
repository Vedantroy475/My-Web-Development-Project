# UltraEdit Download Page Clone

This project is a clone of the UltraEdit download page designed to showcase my web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and overall page structuring. The page replicates features such as language-specific download buttons, SHA256 checksum information, and responsive design elements to mimic the functionality of the original UltraEdit download page.
