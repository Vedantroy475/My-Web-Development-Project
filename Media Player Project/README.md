# HTML Media Player

Welcome to the HTML Media Player project! This project is a simple media player that showcases audio and video files using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the HTML content.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that includes a welcome alert message.
- **Media Files**: A folder which stores 3 audio files and 3 video files.

## File Descriptions

### index.html

This file contains the HTML structure of the media player, including:

- A header with the project title and author name.
- A main section with two subsections: one for listing video files and one for listing audio files.
- Each media file is embedded using the `<video>` and `<audio>` tags.
- A footer with a copyright notice.

### style.css

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure that all media files (audio and video) are in the same directory as the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files. Although there is a `Media Files` folder, it is necessary for the media files to be in the root project directory for the player to function correctly.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the media player.
4. Interact with the audio and video files listed on the page.
